# Kiro-Q Bridge v4

## Clean, Fast, Reliable COMMUNICATION Bridge Between Kiro IDE and Amazon Q Developer

At Kiro's release in July 2025, Q Developer was integrated as an extension its own separate chat interface. Until now though, Kiro & Q could not talk directly to each other, so we've built a lightweight, production-ready MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables seamless communication between Kiro IDE and Amazon Q Developer. This is a **global Kiro utility** that works across all your Kiro projects without needing to be always open in the Kiro IDE.

## 🤝 Kiro + Amazon Q Developer: The Perfect Development Partnership

### Usage

Once installed, the bridge is available **globally** in Kiro IDE:

**Available Tools:**
- `kiro_status` - Get bridge status and current project info
- `send_to_q` - Send messages to Amazon Q with priority levels

**Message Management:**
```bash
# View all messages across projects
./view-messages.sh

# View messages for specific project
./view-messages.sh my-project-name

# Link message history to current project
./link-messages.sh
```

## 🔍 **CRITICAL: Accessing Your Kiro-Q Conversation History**

**📁 Message File Location:** `~/.kiro/q-messages.json`

This file contains ALL communication between you, Kiro, and Amazon Q. It's stored in your home directory's `.kiro` folder, NOT in your current project.

### **How to Access the Conversation History:**

**Option 1: Open Directly in Kiro IDE**
- Press `Cmd+P` (Quick Open) or `Ctrl+P`
- Type: `~/.kiro/q-messages.json`
- Press Enter to open

**Option 2: Use File Menu**
- Go to **File** → **Open**
- Navigate to your home directory
- Show hidden files (if needed)
- Open `.kiro` folder → `q-messages.json`

**Option 3: Copy to Current Workspace**
```bash
cp ~/.kiro/q-messages.json ./kiro-q-messages.json
```

**Option 4: Use Our Utility Scripts**
```bash
# View formatted messages in terminal
./view-messages.sh

# Create symbolic link in current project
./link-messages.sh
```

**Option 5: Terminal View**
```bash
# View raw JSON
cat ~/.kiro/q-messages.json

# Pretty formatted view (requires jq)
cat ~/.kiro/q-messages.json | jq .
```

### **What You'll Find in the Message History:**
- ✅ All your messages to Amazon Q
- ✅ Q's responses and analysis
- ✅ Project context tags for each message
- ✅ Timestamps and priority levels
- ✅ Complete conversation threads
- ✅ Cross-project communication history

**💡 Pro Tip:** Keep this file open in a tab for easy access to your ongoing Q conversations!

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T18:33:37-05:00",
  "version": "4.0.0",
  "bridge_active": true,
  "current_project": "kiro-q-bridge-v4",
  "kiro_dir": "/Users/[username]/.kiro",
  "message_file": "/Users/[username]/.kiro/q-messages.json",
  "server_type": "node-v4"
}
```

### 2. `send_to_q`
Send messages to Amazon Q with priority levels
```json
{
  "message": "Check the build status in your current project",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

## 🔄 Communication Flow

**Kiro → Q Messages (Project-Aware):**
1. User invokes `send_to_q` tool in Kiro
2. Message tagged with current project name
3. Stored in global queue at `~/.kiro/q-messages.json`
4. Amazon Q receives message with project context

**Q → Kiro Messages:**
1. Amazon Q sends messages through MCP protocol
2. Messages appear in conversation history
3. Project context maintained throughout conversation
4. Global message history accessible across all projects

### Troubl
eshooting

**MCP Server Not Connecting?**
```bash
# Check if Node.js is in PATH
which node

# Test the server directly
./test.sh

# Restart Kiro IDE after installation
```

**Messages Not Appearing?**
- Ensure Kiro IDE is restarted after installation
- Check MCP server status in Kiro's feature panel
- Verify `~/.kiro/q-messages.json` exists after sending a message

**Bridge Not Starting?**
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Test server directly
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}' | node mcp-server.js

# Check MCP configuration
cat ~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json
```

## 🌟 Use Cases

### 1. **Proactive Monitoring**
Amazon Q detects issues and sends alerts to Kiro:
> "High memory usage detected in your-project project"

### 2. **Cross-Project Coordination** 
Q manages multiple Kiro projects simultaneously:
> "Switch to project X and run tests while Y is building"

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
Q analyzes patterns and suggests improvements:
> "Consider using npm ci instead of npm install for faster builds"

### 4. **Development Assistance**
Q provides context-aware help based on current project:
> "I see you're working on kiro-q-bridge-v4. The test.sh script shows all tests passing."

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Safe Operation**: Read-only status monitoring
- **Project Isolation**: Messages tagged by project but stored globally
